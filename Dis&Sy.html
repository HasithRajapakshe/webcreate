        <li>2.Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)</li>
        <li>3.Heart problems you're born with (congenital heart defects)</li>

     <h3>Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels</h3>
      <p>
        One common heart disorder that affects the main blood arteries supplying the heart muscle is coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is typically brought on by cholesterol buildup (plaques) in the heart arteries. Atherosclerosis is the term for the accumulation of these plaques (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Blood flow to the heart and other areas of the body is decreased by atherosclerosis. It may result in a stroke, angina, or a heart attack.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>1.Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
        <li>2.Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>3.Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed</li>
        <li>4.Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back</li>
       
     </ol>
   <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats</h3>
   <p>Heart arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, are a group of conditions characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the heart. This can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. Arrhythmias can manifest in various symptoms, ranging from subtle palpitations to more severe manifestations such as fainting or cardiac arrest. Identifying and understanding these symptoms is crucial for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of heart disease.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>1.Fainting (syncope) or near fainting</li>
    <li>2.Chest pain or discomfort</li>
    <li>3.Dizziness</li>
    <li>4.Fluttering in the chest</li>
    <li>5.Lightheadedness</li>
    <li>6.Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)</li>
    <li>7.Shortness of breath</li>
    <li>8.Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)</li>
   
 </ol>
 <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects</h3>
 <p>Usually, significant congenital cardiac abnormalities are discovered shortly after delivery. Symptoms of a congenital cardiac problem in children may include:</p>
 <p>pale lips or skin that is gray or blue (cyanosis)
    swelling around the eyes, in the tummy, or in the legs
    breathing difficulties during feedings in a baby, which prevents them from gaining enough weight</p>
   <p> It is common for less severe congenital cardiac abnormalities to be undiagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood. Congenital cardiac problems can cause symptoms that are typically not life-threatening right away, such as:</p>
   <p>breathing difficulties when exercising or doing other physical activity
    Easily fatigued during physical exertion
    hands, ankles, or feet swelling</p>
<h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)</h3>
<p>Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>1.Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting</li>
    <li>2.Fatigue</li>
    <li>3.Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest</li>
    <li>4.Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath</li>
    <li>5.Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering</li>
    <li>6.Swollen legs, ankles or feet</li>
   
 </ol>
 <h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease)</h3>
 <p>The aortic, mitral, pulmonary, and tricuspid valves are the four valves in the heart. In order to pump blood through the heart, they open and close. There are numerous ways to harm the heart valves. A heart valve can develop prolapse, regurgitation, or insufficiency, narrowing (stenosis), or leakage (prolapse).</p>
 <p>Heart valve disease is another name for valve disease. The following are typical symptoms of cardiac valve disease, depending on which valve isn't functioning properly:</p>
 <ol>
    <li>1.Chest pain</li>
    <li>2.Fainting (syncope)</li>
    <li>3.Fatigue</li>
    <li>4.Irregular heartbeat</li>
    <li>5.Shortness of breath</li>
    <li>6.Swollen feet or ankles</li>
   
 </ol>

            <h2>Science of Cardiovascular System</h2><br>
    <div>
          <p>The circulatory system in humans is an organ system that transports blood via vessels to and from every area of the body, supplying tissues with nutrients and oxygen while expelling waste products like carbon dioxide. It is a closed tubular system with a muscular heart that pumps blood. Venous, capillary, and arterial components make up the pulmonary and systemic circuits.</p><br>

          <h2>Blood</h2><br>
        <p>Blood is a fluid connective tissue that is carried throughout the body by the heart's pumping action through blood vessels. All of the body's cells receive oxygen and nutrition from the blood, which also removes carbon dioxide and other waste products from the cells for excretion. Among its many other roles, blood maintains the body's pH balance, repairs bodily tissues, and carries a host of other chemicals.

            Blood's fluid component is referred to as plasma. It is a thin, yellowish liquid with dissolved materials and blood cells in it.</p><br>

            <p>The primary job of red blood cells is to transport oxygen throughout the body. Hemoglobin is a protein that binds oxygen and contains iron, making up the majority of red blood cells.
                Compared to red blood cells, white blood cells are significantly less common. They protect the body in different ways. For instance, phagocytes, a type of white blood cell, take up and eliminate infections, dead cells, and other blood waste.
                Cell fragments called platelets are essential for blood coagulation. They adhere to blood vessel tears as well as to one another, creating a clog at the site of injury. Chemicals required for coagulation are also released by them.</p><br>
          <h2>What does the cardiovascular system do?</h2><br>
        <p>The primary function of the heart is to serve as a muscular pump propelling blood into and through vessels to and from all parts of the body. The arteries, which receive this blood at high pressure and velocity and conduct it throughout the body, have thick walls that are composed of elastic fibrous tissue and muscle cells. The arterial tree—the branching system of arteries—terminates in short, narrow, muscular vessels called arterioles, from which blood enters simple endothelial tubes (i.e., tubes formed of endothelial, or lining, cells) known as capillaries. These thin, microscopic capillaries are permeable to vital cellular nutrients and waste products that they receive and distribute. From the capillaries, the blood, now depleted of oxygen and burdened with waste products, moving more slowly and under low pressure, enters small vessels called venules that converge to form veins, ultimately guiding the blood on its way back to the heart.</p>

        <h2>The Heart Description Shape and Location</h2><br>
        <p>The average dimensions and weight of an adult human heart are around 13 × 9 × 6 cm (5 × 3.5 × 2.5 inches) and 10.5 ounces (300 grams), respectively. The heart is typically slightly larger than a closed fist. It is fashioned like a cone, with the wide base pointing above and to the right and the apex pointing leftward and downward. It is situated between the lungs and above the diaphragm, which is the muscular wall that separates the chest and abdominal cavities, in the thoracic cavity of the chest, behind the sternum, in front of the windpipe, the esophagus, and the descending aorta. The left side of the midline contains around two thirds of the heart.</p>

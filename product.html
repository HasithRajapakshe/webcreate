    <h2>Heart medicines</h2><br>
    <p>For the treatment of cardiac disease, a wide range of medications are administered. It's possible that you need to take multiple medications daily. Even though managing this could be challenging at times, bear in mind that your doctor wants to keep you as healthy as possible and will work to discover the finest medications with the fewest side effects.</p>
    <br><h2>Different types of medicines</h2><br>
      <h4 class="focl">ACE inhibitors </h4>
      <p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are medications that assist in reducing blood pressure by relaxing the arteries and veins. ACE inhibitors stop the body's production of angiotensin 2, an agent that narrows blood vessels, via an enzyme. This constriction makes the heart work harder and may result in elevated blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin 2 releases blood pressure-raising chemicals.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="focl">Angiotensin-II antagonists</h4>
        <p>High blood pressure is treated with a class of medications called angiotensin 2 receptor blockers. Another name for this class of medication is angiotensin II receptor blockers.

            The body produces the chemical angiotensin, which causes blood arteries to narrow. Blood pressure can increase when blood arteries are narrowed.
            
            Angiotensin 2 is blocked by angiotensin 2 receptor blockers. Consequently, the medication lowers blood pressure by relaxing the body's arteries and veins.</p>

        <h4 class="focl">Anti-arrhythmic medicines</h4>
        <p>Amiodarone is indeed an anti-arrhythmic medication used to treat various types of irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias. These irregular heart rhythms can include atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and others. Amiodarone works by affecting the electrical activity in the heart, helping to stabilize the heart rhythm.</p>

        <h4 class="focl">Anticoagulant medicines</h4>
        <p>Anticoagulants are drugs that aid in the avoidance of blood clots. They are administered to patients who have a high risk of blood clots in order to lower their likelihood of experiencing life-threatening illnesses like heart attacks and strokes.

            A blood clot is a plug that the blood forms around wounds to halt the bleeding. Although they are helpful in halting bleeding, if they form in the wrong location, they may obstruct blood vessels and prevent blood from reaching vital organs like the heart, brain, or lungs.</p>

        <h4 class="focl">Anti-platelet medicines</h4>
        <p>Antiplatelet medications are pharmaceuticals that interfere with the platelet's (small cell fragments involved in clotting) ability to form blood clots. These drugs are essential for preventing peripheral artery disease, heart attacks, and strokes. These are a few typical antiplatelet medications.</p>

        <h2>Lifestyle and home remedies for Cardiovascular diseases</h2><br>
        <p>Certain lifestyle modifications can help to avoid or even treat heart disease. It is advised to make the following adjustments to enhance heart health,</p><br>
        <p>Avoid smoking:One of the main risk factors for heart disease, particularly atherosclerosis, is smoking. The greatest method to lower your risk of heart disease and its complications is to give up smoking. See your provider for assistance if you need it to stop.</p><br>
        <p>Consume wholesome meals:Consume a lot of whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Cut back on salt, sugar, and saturated fats.</p><br>
        <p>Regulate your blood pressure:Serious health issues are more likely to arise when high blood pressure is not under control. If you are 18 years of age or older, have your blood pressure checked at least every two years. You might require more frequent examinations if you are over 40 or have heart disease risk factors. Find out from your doctor what level of blood pressure is ideal for you.</p><br>
        <p>Take a test for cholesterol:When you're in your 20s, and then at least every 4 to 6 years after that, ask your doctor to perform a baseline cholesterol test. If your family has a history of high cholesterol, you might need to start testing sooner. If your test results fall outside of an acceptable range or you have heart disease risk factors, you could require more frequent examinations.</p><br>
        <p>Work out:You can attain and keep a healthy weight by engaging in physical activity. Frequent exercise lowers blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, three risk factors for heart disease. Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week, with your doctor's approval. Find out from your healthcare professional what kind and quantity of exercise is best for you.</p><br>
